			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Hello! Thanks for checking out my portfolio! My name is Diana Tecson and I'm currently a student attending The Coding Bootcamp at UCLA Extension. I'm in the process of switching careers from laboratory technician to software developer. I graduated university with a B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and worked in industry for about a year. I found that I was unsatisfied with the work I was doing. I've always loved technology and believe it's a powerful, driving force in our world. I started coding on my own and fell in love with it. I'm taking my passion for technology and my desire to express my creativity to pursue a career as a developer. I'm excited to continue learning!</p>
